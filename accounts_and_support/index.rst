Request an account
==================

Before requesting an account, please read :ref:`our usage agreement for the LARCC system <usage-agreemet>`.
If you agree with the terms, then review the following instructions carefully. Keep in mind that
**each applicant must log in and complete their own account request using their unique ULINK account**.

**To obtain an account, you must either be a faculty member or be affiliated
with a faculty-led research project**.

..
  If you are employed by outside funding (e.g. grant-enabled student assistants or non-enrolled students),
  or are external to the university but have a working relationship for research purposes, then you may
  qualify for a *Sponsored account*. Refer to Section
  :ref:`Accounts for non-UofL but affiliated individuals <sponsored-accounts>`.

Accounts for UofL individuals

If you are a faculty member,
you are considered the faculty lead/PI and should enter yourself in that role.
If you are not a faculty member, provide the name of the faculty lead/PI
for the research project you will be working on.
