with a faculty-led research project**.

  If you are employed by outside funding (e.g. grant-enabled student assistants or non-enrolled students),
  or are external to the university but have a working relationship for research purposes, then you may
  qualify for a *Sponsored account*. Refer to Section
  :ref:`Accounts for non-UofL but affiliated individuals <sponsored-accounts>`.

for the research project you will be working on.
